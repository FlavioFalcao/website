<p>OpenSeaMap's goal is to add nautical and tourism information a sailor could be interested in to OSM and to present it in a pleasing way. Those include beacons, buoys and other seamarks, port information, repair shops, ship supplies and much more, but also shops, restaurants and places of interest.</p>
