<p>Welcome to OpenSeaMap!
OpenSeaMap's goal is to add nautical and tourism information a sailor could be interested in to OpenStreetMap and to present it in a pleasing and useful way. Those include beacons, buoys and other seamarks, port information, repair shops, ship supplies and much more.  This also includes amenities such as shops, restaurants and places of interest.</p>
